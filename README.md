# AntiInterrupt
Minecraft plugin that blocks Interrupters in a 1v1 PvP Setting for 1.19.x-1.20.x Spigot/Paper

If WorldGuard is installed you must add a flag called "interrupt" and set it to DENY to disable interruptions in that region, if you would like to disable all interruptions in all regions then you can naturally do so by adding said flag to the "\_\_global\_\_" region and denying it there, to allow it in certain regions set it to ALLOW instead of DENY

This plugin is not currently hosted on any platform and you'll have to build it yourself sorry :D
